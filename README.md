Need to consider if it's better to use points that defelct a lot, or add a third reference point in the middle of the animal and instead, and use points that come towards/away from this point. Sometimes deflections do not occur in the desired direction. If plotted, the x-y values for points that move away in a bad direction would probably stick out.
